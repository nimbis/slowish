slowish
=======
This is a Django app intended to provide a lightweight implementation
of the Swift (OpenStack Object Storage) API to be used in testing.

This app is *not* intended as a production-ready implementation of
Swift. Go see the real thing from OpenStack for that:

	http://docs.openstack.org/developer/swift/
        https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Swift

This app is also not intended to be a complete implementation of the
Swift API. Things have been added here strictly on an as-needed basis
as slowish-using applications have been developed.
